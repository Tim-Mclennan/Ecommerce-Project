The objective of creating this Ecommerce Project is to showcase some of the frontend skills I have learnt while attending Nology's software engineering program. 

The languages and tools I have used in this project include:
- HTML
- CSS 
- SCSS
- Javascript 
- React
- Bootstrap


## Features

- End user can browse and purchase a PC in an available colour.
- PC data stored in Google Firestore (Database).

- Minimalist colour palette that can be easily modified from a 'themes.scss' module.

## Lessons Learned

- **What did you learn while building this project?**

The main skills I developed from this project were predominantly focused on Document Object Maniuplation and getting my hands dirty with an Application Programming Interface. 



Another lesson I learnt from this project was how Asynchronous functions work.


- **What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**

One of the major challenges I faced was iterating through and displaying multiple API data points to the HTML doc.
